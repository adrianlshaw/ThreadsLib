*******************************************

* Thread.h includes almost every thing required. Struct thread_t is provided to hold thread id, state and context etc. However, threads.h file is not included into threads.c and Struct thread_t is redefined in threads.c. 

* Changes made in the code to include threads.h. Code worked well with these changes and the provided header file. Changes are commented with the format /********/ and capitals.

* Scheduling is merged inside the join function. It could be a better option to implement scheduling as a separate function (just a comment). 

Provided: 
	- List of threads
	- thread_create
	- thread_yield
	- thread_exit
	- thread_sleep
	- thread_join
	- pre-emptive scheduling
	- timer signals etc.

* Overall a good attempt to provide solution succeeded to achieve required output.

* Code commented well.
